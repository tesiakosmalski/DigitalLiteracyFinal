One of the themes of digital literacy is that of 'Meaning Making.' It isn't a value or an activity that or a piece of code. But it's the responsibility that we have to guide or find after we've used digital technologies.
Companies, product teams, research and development teams, and DIY entrepenuers frequently connect strategies to the development of their technologies. But, its the role of technical communications to ensure

In the end, the greatest lesson in Fabric is this: that meaning still needs to be made by people that see a healthy narrative in all things.
