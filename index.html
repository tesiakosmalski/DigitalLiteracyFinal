    Through the last semester, I found three key themes that have helped and will continue to help me understand, learn, and contextualize digital technologies.
    The first of these themes is the idea of making meaning in digital technologies and within the role of a technical communicator. The second is dynamic delivery and what it means
    to the way content is consumed. The third is digital embodiment and its place in helping understand the future of digital technologies.

    The themes I've discovered that are most important to me are embodiment, meaning making, dynamic delivery.
    The intersection of digital technologies and the body is very important. As more sophisticated
    codes programming and devices continue to evolve, its important to understand how we live and breathe,
    how it is that seamless integration works.

    Dynamic delivery, is what I'm calling it, but consider publishing content part of it. Structured authoring
    is another way to dynamically deliver. My copy isn't the best. As one could tell. But publishing in so many
    ways. I had heard of responsive sites. But, didn't have insight into the workings.

    The big question though is: how does all this knowledge effect the way I write or the way I develop content.
    I don't know how. But, its helpful to think of the ways I developed content before.

    How many things work better in my own voice. Where should it be in scholarship?
    I will say writing for a formal paper, writing in a work processing program, makes the most
    a PDF is meant to be a static document, unchangable. Using the language of HTML makes me think about
    of interactivity. Content is meant to worked with and interacted with. (Look at that Interactivity article)

    What other things are going on? I'm not totally sure. :D

    <i>As you know, this project is part of an overall effort to Build Digital Literacy through exploration and/or curation work with the Fabric archive. This Fall term, seven instructors from four institutions assigned various "Fabric" assignments as part of working to build digital literacy. This team of instructors is interested in a short set of questions (see below). As part of your final assignment in this course (Digital Literacy Scholarship), please respond to these questions if or when it makes sense to do so as part of your overall digital literacy scholarship.

To what extent is your work with the Fabric of Digital Life influencing your understanding of digital literacy?
What are the most challenging aspects of this assignment? Why? How did you overcome them?
Were there any mental models, metaphors, or other experiences youâ€™ve had that you used as a way to understand Fabric as you worked with it? If so, can you say a little about them?
Thanks again. As always, I look forward to your writing / scholarship. </i>

My experience with 'Fabric of Digital Life' is opening my mind and give it exercise in terms of embodiment. The discussion of embodiment is
part of the weave of dynamic delivery. To me digital literacy is the ability to read, write, and communicate with different languages. I'm literate
now to the extent that I can read in code, write in code. Though I can not read and write in the technology necessary for the . The point is how does
knowing how to do this reflect in our writing.

The Fabric of Digital Life site is giving me more context on how it is that digital technology is. By applying keywords, and especially by understanding how to apply the keywords, its taught me how to unpack concepts.
I think back to the article I read about information architecture. It helps me isolate the real themes in any. It also helps me making meaning
of the world around me. The splintered, scattered nature of technology and information helps center it. Digital technology is advancing so fast
that its difficult to tell where the real progress is and where the real patterns are.

The challening pieces of the assignment were narrowing down the key words. It wasn't always obvious to us. We were also reaching out.
Seeking out a direction that we wanted to push for instead of watching for steady patterns. In retrospect, I wonder if we did the right thing.
It was born out of a fancy. That the new hardware is going to be the worst or the best.

For the abstract, it was difficult to know if there was a template or a general approach for us to follow. We also
didn't have a scientist on hand to make sure we knew what we were talking about. It was speculation. We had to dig for it.

The mental model we used was ... ?
What were some collections that were especially important to me? Huh? What? Add some here.

How does my digital literacy connect to my world. Now I have a sense of the role of the content strategist as a meaning maker,
is this how I will position myself in the world? I could play with the idea of this. But it can help me push towards the industry that I am interested in.
I'd really like to go into the health or science field. What does that mean, exactly? I'm not sure.
But, its truly not alone there. Right?
(is this right, could there be a simpler way to say this?)

I think embodiment relates to medical devices and how we work through issues with our bodies.

Amplify or understand. Terms that people like us end up using.

How do specific uses of technologies impact my literacy? Using structured authoring helped me think
about delivery, scale, longevity of information. It made me set the words back. It made me
let go of the words. Is it a process, a resource, idea. And unpack the things.

How does the work on this site give it up? It should be flexible enough to read anywhere. But its meant
to be an open framework. The goal of the paper is to ... communicate my literacy. To do so, I feel like I should
celebrate the basic HTML knowledge I've gained. I WISH there could be.

Meaning making could be a
<video src="" autoplay poster="posterimage.jpg">. Meaning is supposed to be what exactly .... ??? </video>
I don't know exactly yet. But let's just do it.
